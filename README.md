# DVD Screensaver
A simple, easily customizable website, made with the classic HTML + CSS + JS trio, that simulates the DVD screensaver.

## What is this?
***Bouncing DVD Logo**, or **DVD Screensaver**, refers to the animated screensaver commonly found on American DVD players, in which the DVD Video logo bounces to different parts of the screen and changes color. Online and in pop culture, people brag and joke about seeing the logo land perfectly in the corner of the screen.*
